            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu MC (pronounced [bɔjaˈdʒiu]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as
                Mother Teresa,[pron 1] was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun and the founder of the Missionaries of
                Charity. She was born Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu[pron 2] in Skopje, part of the Ottoman Empire at the
                time.[b] At the age of 18, she moved to Ireland and then to India, where she lived most of her life. On
                4 September 2016, she was canonised as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. The anniversary of her death, 5
                September, is her feast day.
            </p>
            <p>Mother Teresa founded Missionaries of Charity, a religious congregation, which grew to have over 4,500
                nuns across 133 countries as of 2012.[6] The congregation manages homes for people who are dying of
                HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and tuberculosis. The congregation also runs soup kitchens, dispensaries, mobile
                clinics, children's and family counselling programmes, as well as orphanages and schools. Members take
                vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and also profess a fourth vow: to give "wholehearted free
                service to the poorest of the poor."[7]</p>
            <h2>Recognition in India</h2>
            <p>
                From the Indian government, under the name of Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, Mother Teresa was issued a
                diplomatic passport.[78] She received the Padma Shri in 1962 and the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for
                International Understanding in 1969.[79] She later received other Indian awards, including the Bharat
                Ratna (India's highest civilian award) in 1980.[80] Mother Teresa's official biography, by Navin Chawla,
                was published in 1992.[81] In Calcutta, she is worshipped as a deity by some Hindus.[82]
            </p>
            <p>To commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special ₹5 coin (the
                amount of money Mother Teresa had when she arrived in India) on 28 August 2010. President Pratibha Patil
                said, "Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a
                symbol of hope to many—namely, the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally
                ill, and those abandoned by their families."[83]</p>
            <h2>Nobel Peace Prize</h2>
            <p>
                In 1979, Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize "for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome
                poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace".[115] She refused the conventional
                ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India[116] and
                saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. When
                Mother Teresa received the prize she was asked, "What can we do to promote world peace?" She answered,
                "Go home and love your family." Building on this theme in her Nobel lecture, she said: "Around the
                world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to
                remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I
                have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved,
                terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society – that poverty is so hurtable [sic] and so
                much, and I find that very difficult."
            </p>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Mother Teresa has been commemorated by museums and named the patroness of a number of churches. She has
                had buildings, roads and complexes named after her, including Albania's international airport. Mother
                Teresa Day (Dita e Nënë Terezës), 5 September, is a public holiday in Albania. In 2009, the Memorial
                House of Mother Teresa was opened in her hometown of Skopje, North Macedonia. The Cathedral of Blessed
                Mother Teresa in Pristina, Kosovo, is named in her honour.[164] The demolition of a historic high school
                building to make way for the new construction initially sparked controversy in the local community, but
                the high school was later relocated to a new, more spacious campus. Consecrated on 5 September 2017, it
                became the first cathedral in Mother Teresa's honour and the second extant one in Kosovo.</p>
